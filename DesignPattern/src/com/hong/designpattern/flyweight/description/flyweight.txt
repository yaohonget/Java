Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created, to decrease memory footprint and increase performance. 
This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern provides ways to decrease objects count thus improving application required objects structure. 
Flyweight pattern try to reuse already existing similar kind objects by storing them and creates new object when no matching object is found.
